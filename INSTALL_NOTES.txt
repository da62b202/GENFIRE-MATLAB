There are two versions of the gridding function, "fillinFourierGrid" and "fillinFourierGrid_C". The one tagged
with _C is faster uses the MEX function "weightVals.cpp". To use it, you must first have a C++ compiler installed such as Microsoft Visual Studio
for Windows, or g++ on MAC/Linux. If you are not familiar with how setting up a compiler or mex works, don't be afraid -- it's really easy!
Most computer setups only require you to download/install the compiler and MATLAB will automatically detect it. You may need to enter the command    mex -setup
MEX stands for MATLAB EXecuteable, and it takes functions written in other langauges like C/C++ (which are generally much faster than MATLAB code)
and converts them into something that can be read by MATLAB.
Once you have this setup in order to use this function you must compile it in MATLAB with the following command:

mex weightVals.cpp 


If you get a success message, you should then be able to use "fillinFourierGrid_C" just like "fillinFourierGrid"
If for some reason compiling fails and you are unable to troubleshoot why mex is not working,
you can just use "fillinFourierGrid" by changing the variable "griddingMethod" in GENFIRE_Main.m. It does the same thing, but is slower.
You can swap between methods by changing the parameter griddingMethod in GENFIRE_Main. I have tested and the function
weightVals.cpp correctly compiles and runs of 64 bit Windows, 64 bit Mac OSX 10, and the version of Linux run on Hoffman2

After that, run reconstructions with GENFIRE_Main.m or one of the specialized versions
