%% GENFIRE is a robust, Fourier-based reconstruction algorithm that is
%% capable of using a limited set of input projections to generate a 3D reconstruction
%% while also partially retrieving missing projection information. It does this by iterating 
%% between real and reciprocal space and applying simple constraints in each to find an optimal solution that  
%% correlates with the input projections while simultaneously obeying real space conditions
%% such as positivity (the assumption that there is no negative electron density)
%% and support (we require that the 3D object resulting from zero padded projections
%% exists entirely within some smaller region). The result is a more consistent 
%% and faithful reconstruction with superior contrast and, in many cases, resolution when
%% compared with more traditional 3D reconstruction algorithms such as
%% Filtered Back-Projection.

%% the larger projections, then crop a window out and pad that with zeros for reconstruction.
